This website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using a heavily modified version of the
[terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).

The font is [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka), which I also use for all my terminals
and text editors. It's great! (I realize that I am a crazy person for using a monospaced font for
body text. It just looks so much more normal to me.)

The terminal theme asks that this license be included with derived works:
