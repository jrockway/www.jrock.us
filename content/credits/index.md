This website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using a heavily modified version of the
[terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).

The heading font is [Oswald](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oswald). It is distributed under the
temrs of the SIL Open Font Licnese, Version 1.1.

The body font is [Open Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/download/open-sans). It is
distributed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.

The code font is [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka), which I also use for all my
terminals and text editors. It's great!

The terminal theme asks that this license be included with derived works:
