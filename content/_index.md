Welcome to `jrock.us`. I'm your host, June Rockway!

For much of my life, I was known as Jonathan. I have adjusted my name to be more
aligned with my gender identity.

You might enjoy [my Github](https://github.com/jrockway/), [my blog](/posts/),
or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jrock.us).

My amateur radio callsign is `KD2DTW`.

Elsewhere on the Internets, I'm usually `jrockway`.

Feedback is always welcome. My email address is june&#x40;jrock.us.
